                <h2>Beaded Jewelry</h2>
                <p>Beaded jewelry in Palawan is an important aspect of the regionâ€™s rich cultural heritage, particularly among its indigenous groups, such as the Tagbanua, Bajau, and Palawan peoples. These communities have long been skilled in the art of beadwork, creating intricate and vibrant jewelry that not only serves as decorative adornment but also carries cultural significance. Beads are crafted from a variety of materials, including seeds, shells, bones, and coral, reflecting the natural resources available to the indigenous people of Palawan.</p>
                <p>The Tagbanua people are especially known for their detailed beaded necklaces, earrings, and headpieces, which are often worn during ceremonial occasions or rituals. The beads used in their jewelry are typically sourced from seeds and shells, which are collected from the sea and local forests. These beads are then carefully strung together in intricate patterns, with each piece often representing a specific spiritual belief, cultural identity, or social status within the community. The Tagbanua also use their beaded jewelry in wedding ceremonies, where they exchange these items as symbols of unity and respect.</p>
