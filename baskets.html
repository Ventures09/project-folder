                <h2>Woven Baskets</h2>
                <p>The woven baskets of Davao del Norte are a vivid expression of the indigenous peoples’ creativity, functionality, and cultural identity. These handwoven containers, crafted from natural materials such as nito vine, rattan, bamboo, and pandan leaves, have been used for centuries in the daily lives of communities across the province. Whether for carrying harvested crops, storing personal belongings, or participating in ritual exchanges, these baskets reflect a deep interdependence between artistry and utility.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Among the most notable basket-weaving communities in Davao del Norte are the Ata-Manobo and Mandaya tribes, whose weaving traditions are passed down through generations. The intricate patterns, tight weave, and structural integrity of the baskets demonstrate not only technical skill but also symbolic meaning. Patterns often incorporate traditional motifs that represent natural elements like rivers, mountains, and ancestral spirits, reflecting the tribes’ relationship with the environment and their cosmological beliefs.</p>

                <h2>Further Information of Woven Basket</h2>
                <p>Each basket is made by hand, without modern machinery, requiring days or even weeks of work depending on the complexity. The process involves harvesting, drying, and stripping natural fibers, which are then dyed using plant-based pigments before being meticulously woven into specific shapes and forms. Common types include the “bayong”, used for market goods; “labba”, a round-bottomed basket for farm produce; and “sabak”, a shoulder-carried container.</p>
