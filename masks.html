Artisans carefully select natural materials, shaping and decorating the masks with precision. The process of creating these masks is a communal effort, often involving not only the artisans but also elders and spiritual leaders who ensure the masks’ authenticity and spiritual connection. Today, these masks are not only used in traditional ceremonies but are also sold at local markets and cultural events, promoting awareness of the region's rich cultural heritage and indigenous craftsmanship.</p>
