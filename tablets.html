                <h2>Stone Tablets</h2>
                <p>The stone tablet of Tawi-Tawi is an important archaeological find that provides valuable insight into the early history and cultural practices of the region. Discovered in the 1980s, this stone tablet, often referred to as the Tawi-Tawi Inscription, is believed to date back to the 14th century and is regarded as one of the most significant historical artifacts in the Philippines. It is carved with Arabic script, suggesting the early presence of Islamic influence in the region long before the arrival of the Spanish.</p>
                <p>The Tawi-Tawi stone tablet is made of limestone and measures about 30 centimeters in height and 20 centimeters in width. The inscription on the tablet is written in Jawi, an Arabic-based script used in Malay-speaking regions during the period of Islamic influence. The contents of the inscription are often interpreted as a decree or royal edict, possibly related to trade, governance, or religious matters, and reflect the integration of Islamic culture with the local traditions of the Suluk or TausÅ«g people, who were among the earliest to adopt Islam in the Philippines.</p>

                <p>The discovery of this stone tablet underscores the significant role that Islam played in the early history of the Philippines, particularly in the Sulu Archipelago and Tawi-Tawi. It provides evidence of early Islamic governance systems, including the use of written decrees, and serves as an important piece of the region's pre-colonial history.

It serves as an important reminder of the region's rich history and the cultural, religious, and political systems that existed long before Western colonization. The tablet stands as a valuable artifact, representing the cultural heritage of the Sulu Archipelago and the enduring legacy of early Islamic influence in the Philippines.</p>
