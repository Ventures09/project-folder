                <h2>Folk Pottery</h2>
                <p>Folk pottery in Bukidnon reflects the deep-rooted cultural traditions and craftsmanship of the indigenous groups in the region, particularly the Manobo, Higaonon, and Talaandig peoples. Pottery making in Bukidnon has been a tradition passed down through generations, with each piece crafted by hand from locally sourced clay and fired using traditional techniques. The pottery is not only functional but also serves as a form of artistic expression deeply intertwined with the spiritual and cultural beliefs of the indigenous communities.</p>
                
                <p>The Manobo people of Bukidnon are known for their distinctive pottery designs, which often include geometric patterns, symbols of nature, and representations of animals or ancestral spirits. These designs are not merely decorative; they carry deep meanings tied to rituals and community life, serving as vessels for cooking, storage, and even ceremonial purposes. The Higaonon and Talaandig tribes also engage in pottery-making, with each tribe having its own unique techniques and styles, but all share the common tradition of using natural materials that connect them to their environment.</p>

                <h2>Further Discoveries of Folk Pottery</h2>
                <p>The process of pottery making in Bukidnon is a meticulous craft. Artisans first gather and prepare the clay, which is then shaped by hand, often using simple tools such as sticks or stones. Once shaped, the pottery is left to dry, and then it is fired in a traditional kiln or open fire. The firing process is especially important, as it ensures the durability of the pottery while giving each piece a unique texture and color. In some cases, the pottery is decorated with natural dyes or burned patterns, further adding to its aesthetic and symbolic significance.</p>
